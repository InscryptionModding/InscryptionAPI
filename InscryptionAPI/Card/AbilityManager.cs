    /// The reason the abilities are cloned before processing is so that you can make any change to them you wish
    /// without affecting the original ability. This means that you do not need to try to track changes or remember
    /// what the original version of the ability looked like before you started changing it; the next time 
    /// [SyncAbilityList](xref:InscryptionAPI.AbilityManager.SyncAbilityList) is called, all changes will be reverted

    /// that same list back.
